## Heya! ^~^

I'm Lui. I build stuff, and I occasionally break stuff.

I love writing low-level code, such as operating systems, drivers, game engines, compilers, and embedded / IoT.

I also like working on games, and I do some [3D modelling](https://www.artstation.com/av01d) on the side.

I have a passion for Linux and [FOSS](https://www.fsf.org/) (Free and Open Source Software) in general. I use Linux on all my machines, both for development and daily PC usage.
I also try to use FOSS everywhere I possibly can. Whether it's for programming, gaming, music making or art, I always prioritize software that respects the user.

### 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on any project I can!
As long as it's not too far outside my area of expertise, I'm willing to work on it.
